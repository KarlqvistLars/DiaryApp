# DiaryApp
This is a project for making a diary application to easier make same daily notes and make it more fun for me to do it.</br>
The plan for this projekt is to first just create a working version of the program concept idea and after that refactor </br>
the code to full object oriented code so the vistors of this repository can see and follow the progress of the programming work. 
I will do this on my spare time.</br></br>
# Status is: Realesed version 1.1.
</br></br>
The realesed version is avalibel in directory.</br>
