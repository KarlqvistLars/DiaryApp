# DiaryApp
This is a project for making a diary application to easier make same daily notes and make it more fun for me to do it.</br>
The plan for this projekt is to first just create a working version of the program concept idea and after that refactor </br>
the code to full object oriented code so the vistors of this repository can see and follow the progress of the programming work.</br>
</br>
# Update README.md 2024-01-21:</br>
The program requires [Maven](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.jgoodies/jgoodies-forms/1.8.0?smo=true)  jgoodies-forms-1.8.0 framwork to run. </br>
This is now includen in the repo.</br>

The current release UML draft to make quick overview on the code is displayed here:</br>
This was my first own javaproject and there are room for many improvments. </br>
But I made it for fun and my own educational purpose.</br>
